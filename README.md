# Unity Command Line Tool (Headless)
A project demonstrating how you can use to make a command line tool with Unity and have it run in the background.

Run your Unity standalone apps in the background using command line. In this tool I only write to arguments to the (Player) log.

There is a read me file inside the Docs folder to help you get started.
